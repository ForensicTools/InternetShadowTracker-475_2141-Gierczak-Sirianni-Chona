Description
===========

BrowsingHistoryView is a utility that reads the history data of 4
different Web browsers (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google
Chrome, and Safari) and displays the browsing history of all these Web
browsers in one table. The browsing history table includes the following
information: Visited URL, Title, Visit Time, Visit Count, Web browser and
User Profile. BrowsingHistoryView allows you to watch the browsing
history of all user profiles in a running system, as well as to get the
browsing history from external hard drive.
You can also export the browsing history into csv/tab-delimited/html/xml
file from the user interface, or from command-line, without displaying
any user interface.

    IE10 (WebCacheV24.dat or WebCacheV01.dat), and the
    /UseVolumeShadowCopy command-line option added on v1.15 was removed
    from this version.
    Be aware that during browsing on IE10, you may get corrupted history

System Requirements
===================

This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows 2000,
and up to Windows 8. Both 32-bit and x64 systems are supported.

The following Web browsers are supported:
* Internet Explorer (Version 4.00 and greater)
* Mozilla Firefox (Version 3.00 and greater)
* Google Chrome
* Safari



Known Limitations and Problems
==============================


* 'Visit Count' on Internet Explorer Web browser: The 'Visit Count'
  column is taken "as is" from the history file of Internet Explorer.
  Unfortunately, Internet Explorer tend to extremely bloat the 'Visit
  Count' number, which means that you cannot assume that the 'Visit
  Count' number represents the actual number of times that the user
  visited the specified Web site. This remark is only relevant for
  Internet Explorer. Other Web browsers count the number of visits
  properly, as far as I know.



Start Using BrowsingHistoryView
===============================

BrowsingHistoryView doesn't require any installation process or
additional dll files. In order to start using it, simply run the
executable file - BrowsingHistoryView.exe

After you run BrowsingHistoryView, the 'Advanced Options' window is
displayed. By default, BrowsingHistoryView offers you to load the history
of all Web browsers and all user profiles in the last 10 days, but you
can change the options according to your needs.

After pressing 'Ok' in the 'Advanced Options' window, BrowsingHistoryView
loads and displays the browsing history according to the options you
chose.



The 'Advanced Options' Window
=============================


* Filter by visit date/time: Allows you to load the history from the
  last number of days/hours, or from specific date/time range.
* Web Browsers: BrowsingHistoryView will load the history only from the
  selected Web browsers. For example, if you want to only get the
  browsing history of Internet Explorer, then you need to select the
  'Internet Explorer' check-box and deselect all others.
* Load history from: Allows you to choose the data source of the
  browsing history:
  o Load history from the current running system (All users): If you
    choose this option, BrowsingHistoryView scans all the user profiles
    on your system (C:\Documents and Settings or C:\Users) and loads the
    history data from them.
    Be aware that the Registry file of every user profile (NTUSER.DAT)
    should be readable, because BrowsingHistoryView uses the Registry
    file to locate the correct history file/folder of every Web browser.
    If BrowsingHistoryView cannot read NTUSER.DAT, it'll try to locate
    the correct folders in other less reliable ways.
  o Load history from the current running system (Only current user):
    If you choose this option, BrowsingHistoryView loads only the
    browsing history of the current logged-on user.
  o Load history from the specified profiles folder: If you choose
    this option, BrowsingHistoryView scans all the user profiles under
    the specified folder. The specified folder should be something like
    H:\Documents and Settings (On Windows XP) or H:\Users (On Windows
    7/2008/Vista/8).
    Be aware that the Registry file of every user profile (NTUSER.DAT)
    should be readable, because BrowsingHistoryView uses the Registry
    file to locate the correct history file/folder of every Web browser.
    If BrowsingHistoryView cannot read NTUSER.DAT, it'll try to locate
    the correct folders in other less reliable ways.
  o Load history from the specified profile: If you choose this
    option, BrowsingHistoryView loads the history from the specified
    profile folder. The specified profile folder should be something like
    H:\Documents and Settings\Administrator (On Windows XP) or
    H:\Users\Administrator (On Windows 7/2008/Vista/8).





Reading History From Remote Computer
====================================

If you have read access to the user profiles in another computer on your
network, you can use BrowsingHistoryView to directly view the browsing
history of the remote computer. However, due to the fact that the
Registry file on the remote computer is probably locked, in some systems
BrowsingHistoryView might fail to locate the correct history files or
folders.

In order to view the browsing history of all user profiles in a remote
computer, use the 'Load history from the specified profiles folder'
option, and then type the profiles folder on the remote computer, for
example: \\192.168.0.10\c$\users

In order to view the browsing history of a single user profile in a
remote computer, use the 'Load history from the specified profile'
option, and then type the profile folder on the remote computer, for
example: \\192.168.0.10\c$\users\user01



Command-Line Options
====================



/cfg <Filename>
Start BrowsingHistoryView with the specified configuration file. For
example:
BrowsingHistoryView.exe /cfg "c:\config\bhv.cfg"
BrowsingHistoryView.exe /cfg "%AppData%\BrowsingHistoryView.cfg"

/stext <Filename>
Save the browsing history into a regular text file.

/stab <Filename>
Save the browsing history into a tab-delimited text file.

/scomma <Filename>
Save the browsing history into a comma-delimited text file (csv).

/stabular <Filename>
Save the browsing history into a tabular text file.

/shtml <Filename>
Save the browsing history into HTML file (Horizontal).

/sverhtml <Filename>
Save the browsing history into HTML file (Vertical).

/sxml <Filename>
Save the browsing history into XML file.

/sort <column>
This command-line option can be used with other save options for sorting
by the desired column. If you don't specify this option, the list is
sorted according to the last sort that you made from the user interface.
The <column> parameter can specify the column index (0 for the first
column, 1 for the second column, and so on) or the name of the column,
like "Title" and "URL". You can specify the '~' prefix character (e.g:
"~Visit Time") if you want to sort in descending order. You can put
multiple /sort in the command-line if you want to sort by multiple
columns.

Examples:
BrowsingHistoryView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\history.html" /sort 2 /sort ~1
BrowsingHistoryView.exe /shtml "f:\temp\history.html" /sort "URL" /sort
"Visit Time"

/nosort
When you specify this command-line option, the list will be saved without
any sorting.

/SaveDirect
Save the browsing history in SaveDirect mode. For using with the other
save command-line options ( /scomma, /stab, /sxml, and so on...) When you
use the SaveDirect mode, the history lines are saved directly to the
disk, without loading them into the memory first. This means that you can
save a list with large amount of history lines into your disk without any
memory problem, as long as you have enough disk space to store the saved
file. The drawback of this mode: You cannot sort the lines according to
the column you choose with /sort command-line option.

/HistorySource <Source>
Specifies the type of history data source:
* 1 - Load history from the current running system (All users).
* 2 - Load history from the current running system (Only current user).
* 3 - Load history from the specified profiles folder
  (/HistorySourceFolder command-line parameter).
* 4 - Load history from the specified profile (/HistorySourceFolder
  command-line parameter).


/HistorySourceFolder <Folder>
Specifies the folder path if /HistorySource is 3 or 4.

/VisitTimeFilterType <Filter Type>
Specifies the type of date/time filter:
* 1 - Load history from any date/time.
* 2 - Load history from the last xx hours (xx specified in
  /VisitTimeFilterValue)
* 3 - Load history from the last xx days (xx specified in
  /VisitTimeFilterValue)
* 4 - Load history from the specified date/time range (The time range
  is specified in /VisitTimeFrom and /VisitTimeTo)


/VisitTimeFilterValue <Filter Value>
Specifies the filter value when /VisitTimeFilterType is 2 or 3

/VisitTimeFrom <Time>
/VisitTimeTo <Time>
Specifies the date/time range when /VisitTimeFilterType is 4. date/time
value must be in the following format: dd-mm-yyyy hh:nn:ss

For example:
BrowsingHistoryView.exe /VisitTimeFrom "10-01-2012 12:00:00" /VisitTimeTo
"18-02-2012 10:00:00"

/LoadIE <0 | 1>
/LoadFirefox <0 | 1>
/LoadChrome <0 | 1>
/LoadSafari <0 | 1>

Specifies whether to load the history of IE/Firefox/Chrome/Safari Web
browser. 0 = Don't load, 1 = Load.

Here's some command-line examples:
BrowsingHistoryView.exe /HistorySource 4 /HistorySourceFolder
"H:\Documents and Settings\User01" /stab "c:\temp\history.txt"
BrowsingHistoryView.exe /HistorySource 3 /HistorySourceFolder
"G:\Documents and Settings" /VisitTimeFilterType 3 /VisitTimeFilterValue
10 /scomma "c:\temp\history.csv"
BrowsingHistoryView.exe /HistorySource 1 /LoadIE 1 /LoadFirefox 0
/LoadChrome 0 /LoadSafari 0 /shtml "c:\temp\history.html"
BrowsingHistoryView.exe /HistorySource 2 /VisitTimeFilterType 4
/VisitTimeFrom "01-01-2011 00:00:00" /VisitTimeTo "01-01-2012 00:00:00"
/stab "c:\temp\history.txt"



Translating BrowsingHistoryView to other languages
==================================================

In order to translate BrowsingHistoryView to other language, follow the
instructions below:
1. Run BrowsingHistoryView with /savelangfile parameter:
   BrowsingHistoryView.exe /savelangfile
   A file named BrowsingHistoryView_lng.ini will be created in the folder
   of BrowsingHistoryView utility.
2. Open the created language file in Notepad or in any other text
   editor.
3. Translate all string entries to the desired language. Optionally,
   you can also add your name and/or a link to your Web site.
